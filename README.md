Getting Started!Let's get your Smart Farming Assistant up and running! This project consists of two main parts: the powerful backend API and the interactive frontend web application.Prerequisites: Gather Your ToolsBefore you begin, make sure you have these essentials installed:Python 3.x and its package installer, pip.Node.js and its package manager, npm.A WeatherAPI Key (a free tier is available ‚Äì grab yours from WeatherAPI.com).1. Get Your WeatherAPI KeyVisit WeatherAPI.com.Sign up for a free account and locate your unique API key.Important: Open the file backend/main.py and replace the placeholder API key with your actual key:WEATHER_API_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_WEATHERAPI_KEY_HERE" # Update this line!
2. Clone the RepositoryStart by cloning the project files to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/zennyMe17/smart_farming_assistant.git
cd smart_farming_assistant
3. Backend Setup: Ignite the Intelligence!Navigate into the backend directory to set up and launch your API:cd backend
a. Create a Python Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended!)Isolate your Python dependencies for a clean and conflict-free setup:python -m venv venv
b. Activate Your Virtual EnvironmentOn Windows:.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:source venv/bin/activate
c. Install Backend DependenciesInstall all the Python libraries required for the backend:pip install -r requirements.txt
d. Models Directory: The AI's CoreEnsure you have a directory named models located inside your backend folder. This directory must contain all the pre-trained machine learning models and preprocessing tools (the .joblib files). Without these, the prediction engine cannot function!model_crop_type.joblibmodel_fertilizer_name.joblibimputer.joblibscaler.joblibencoder.joblibinput_cols.joblibnumeric_cols.joblibcategorical_cols.joblib(These essential files are generated during the model training phase of the project.)4. Frontend Setup: Bring the Experience to Life!Open a brand new terminal window (keep your backend terminal running in the first one!) and navigate to your frontend directory:cd ../frontend # This command takes you back up to the main project folder, then into 'frontend'
a. Install Frontend DependenciesInstall all the necessary Node.js packages for your Next.js application:npm install
üßë‚Äçüåæ Cultivating Your Results: How to Run the Assistant!With both the backend and frontend meticulously set up, it's time to unleash your Smart Farming Assistant!1. Launch the Backend API (Terminal 1)In your first terminal window (where you performed the backend setup), make sure your virtual environment is still active, then start the FastAPI server:cd backend
# If your virtual environment isn't active, activate it again:
# .\venv\Scripts\activate  (Windows)
# source venv/bin/activate (macOS/Linux)

uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
You'll see messages indicating that the FastAPI application is running. You can even check its interactive documentation by opening http://localhost:8000/docs in your web browser.2. Start the Frontend Web Application (Terminal 2)In your second, separate terminal window (where you set up the frontend), navigate to the frontend directory and fire up the Next.js development server:cd frontend
npm run dev
The frontend application will typically launch on http://localhost:3000.
